            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 20, 2016 by <a href="#">Jericho</a></p>

            <p><i>Warning – Even though the words and sentences of this entry are tame, some of the material and content of the songs I introduce aren’t meant for a child’s ears. So please, don’t try to play them aloud at your workplace.</i></p>
            <hr>
            <p> Hi guys, best officer of the group here. </p> 

            <p> Despite enjoying anime as much as the next guy, I have other hobbies and interests. Playing games, reading fanfics, writing sonnets for my waifus... </p> 

            <p> Most of all though, I love turning up the volume to a dope beat. </p> 

            <p> I listen to a plethora of genres. If I’m trying to run on a treadmill, you know I’d be trapping with Future. If I’m trying to dance at the club, you know I’d be wanting to do the Cabbage Patch to some Owl City music. If I’m trying to be romantic for Mami Tomoe, you know I’d be playing some Cascada while we eat underneath the moon. </p> 

            <p> But you know, sometimes I just want to listen to something anime. Like, a pure love song about the subculture I’ve been in since the Naruto headbands arrived to America. </p> 

            <p> No. I’m not talking about those high energy J-Pop songs that are featured in anime. No. I'm not talking about those degenerate mashups that feature Love Live and DMX. I'm talking about the songs where the dudes are talking about their waifus and going to Akihabara. </p> 

            <p> However, I feel like not a lot of people know about those kinds of songs. And so, I want to share the love. I want to share some of my favorite anime songs with y'all because I think they really deserve a listen. </p> 

            <hr>

            <p> <h3> 5. manglobe – maikis: </h3> </p>
            <p> When Manglobe filed for bankruptcy, it was like a part of the anime community was ripped away. This song depicts the collected pain and sorrow of those who loved the animation from Manglobe. Do any of y’all have that go-to song when you just want to cry? For me, it’s this. The first time I heard this, I felt the hot tears run down my face as I felt the anguish that maikis was spitting. My heart palpitated every time the chorus ran. And the beat. Ahhhh. The beat. It’s like the sky was drenching you in Osamu Tezuka’s tears as the beat hits you in the deepest depths of your soul. </p>

            </p> 

            <p> <h3> 4. Imouto U Don’t Have To Call – Shiki:  </h3> </p>
            <p>If I could ever hang out with Shiki, I’d want to watch <i>Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry</i> with him and discuss about how it’s a revolutionary anime. This rapper is known for repping for all the anime little sisters out there so his songs have a tendency to be imouto-chan songs. However, out of all of them he made, this is one of my favorites. Featuring the melodious background vocals of Usher, this is the type of song Kyousuke Kousaka of <i>Oreimo</i> would serenade to his sister. You can just feel this dude’s passion for his imouto as he raps about the changes they go through as time passes. </p>

            <p> <h3> 3. Nujabes Juke – Sango: </h3> </p>
            <p> Nujabes was a genius producer. I remember I listened to his album, <i>Modal Soul</i>, as if it was my lullaby. If you don’t know about Nujabes, then one important thing to know is his style, which blends hip-hop and jazz into one smooth irresistible beat. It’s like drinking some homemade Japanese tea – it eases you in and immerses you into a world of relaxation. Other than that, he’s known for his music in <i>Samurai Champloo </i>, which is no less than excellent. </p>

            <p>With his passing though, Sango became the dude to go to if I wanted to listen to a slappy beat. Every beat he produces is a good beat that you’d want to listen to over and over again. So when this guy combines his musical talents with a Nujabes beat, it’s like a making a sandwich with the freshest ingredients. Sampling "Shiki no Uta" (the ED of <i>Samurai Champloo</i>) though, it feels more like an ode to 
            <i>Samurai Champloo</i> instead of a salute to Nujabes, which is the primary reason why I put this on the list. </p>

            <p> <h3> 2. Sieg Zeon – Richie Branson: </h3> </p>
            <p> If you play this song on your iPod or whatever, you’re going to have a good day. Out of all the nerdcore songs about anime I’ve listened to, this has to be one of the hardest boastful raps ever. This is the kind of song I’d play on my communicator if I was playing <i>Dynasty Warriors Gundam Reborn</i>. If I was piloting a Zaku, this would be my battle theme if I was against the Sabazi. Richie Branson just goes crazy in this song, dropping bars relentlessly as if he was dropping a colony on a crowd of Guncannons. </p>

            <p> <h3> 1. Himawari – None Like Joshua feat. Richie Branson: </h3> </p>
            <p> This is a rap purely focused on the two main dudes of <i>Samurai Champloo</i>. The beat and the lyrics fit together so wonderfully. It’s like finding the perfect palette. It’s so mellow and so chill that Nujabes would want an encore if he was still alive. This is the kind of song I’d bump to if I was sitting on a sofa while reading the entirety of <i>Oldboy</i>. However, there is one thing I need to warn y’all about. The song has one massive spoiler about the ending of the anime. So for those who haven’t watched it, try to ignore the ending of the second verse of the song. </p>

            <p>I do wish that it had a verse featuring Fuu though. </p>

            <p> <h3> 0. Misty’s Song – Barbi Schiller: </h3> </p>
            <p> A long time ago, I bought <i>2.B.A Master</i>, the old school <i>Pokemon</i> soundtrack featuring hits like “Viridian City” and “Pokerap.” However, the greatest gem of the entire album is “Misty’s Song” – this outstanding 90s sounding RnB love song depicting Misty’s feelings for Ash. You see, I’ve been shipping Ash and Misty together since 2005. So everyone who’s thirsty for Ash (specifically that degenerate Serena) can buy a daikimakura and go home. This is hardcore evidence that Ash and Misty need to be together. Like, when you listen to this song, you just want the two to become a couple and be happy for the rest of their lives. </p>

            <p> If you have other comments, go ahead and say them too. </p> 

            <p> And if you hated this list, come and 1v1 me in <i>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</i>. I’ll beat you down with just Patamon.</p>
